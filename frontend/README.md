## Introduction

Gordon Gym Management System is a modern, full-featured web application for gym management, built using React, Vite, and Firebase. It provides separate dashboards for Admin and Members, with modules for member management, trainers, billing, diet plans, notifications, supplements, and more. The project uses a single MainContext for all global state and data operations, making all functions reusable and maintainable.

## Project Structure



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## MainContext (`MainCon.jsx`)

**MainContext** is the heart of the app. It provides all global state and reusable functions for fetching, updating, deleting, and notifying data throughout the app.  
**All data operations (fetch, update, delete, notify, etc.) are done via MainContext functions, making them reusable and consistent everywhere.**

### MainContext Functions & State

| Function/State                | Description                                                                                  |

| `notifications`, `setNotifications` | Notifications for admin/member                                                    |

| `fetchDataFromDatabase(route)`| **Reusable:** Fetches data from any Firebase collection (e.g., 'bills', 'trainers', etc.)   |
| `fetchMemberData()`           | Fetches all members from Firebase                                                           |
| `fetchNotifications(uid)`     | Fetches notifications for a specific user/member                                            |
| `sendNotification(uid, msg)`  | Sends a notification to a member                                                            |
| `deleteUserFromdataBase(route, id)` | Deletes a record from any collection (e.g., trainers, members, etc.)             |
| `notify(msg, type)`           | Shows toast notification (success, error, etc.)                                             |
| `signInWithEmailPassword(email, pass)` | Authenticates admin using Firebase Auth                                      |
| ...and more                   | All functions are **reusable** and used everywhere via context                              |

**Note:**  
- No direct fetch or database calls in components; always use MainContext functions for all data operations.
- This makes the code DRY, maintainable, and easy to update.
